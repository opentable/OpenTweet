# Project Architecture Documentation

## Overview
This project follows a multi-modular architecture to enhance maintainability, scalability, and reusability. The architecture consists of two main modules: Feature and Frameworks, along with an Interface Components module. Additionally, the project employs the Flow Coordinator pattern to manage navigation, with each feature having its own dedicated flow coordinator.


## 1. Feature Module
The Feature Module is designed to encapsulate business-oriented user flows and functionalities. Each feature module focuses on a specific user scenario or use case, ensuring a modular and decoupled structure. This module includes, among others, the Tweet Feed feature, where users can interact with and view tweets.

Key Components:
Tweet Feed Feature: Implements the tweet feed functionality, allowing users to browse and interact with tweets.

## 2. Frameworks Module
The Frameworks Module serves as a central repository for utility functions, extensions, and other helper classes. It is aimed at providing a set of tools and resources that can be shared across various parts of the application.

Key Components:
Extensions Kit: Contains extensions and utilities to enhance Swift language features.
Helper Classes: Includes various helper classes to handle common tasks, such as networking, date formatting, and more.
Benefits:


## 3. Interface Components
The Interface Components module focuses on creating reusable UI elements that can be utilized throughout the application. It abstracts away the details of the user interface, promoting consistency and maintainability.

Key Components:
Reusable UI Elements: Contains pre-designed and customizable UI components, such as buttons, labels, and views.

## 4. Flow Coordinators
The project adopts the Flow Coordinator pattern for navigation management. Each feature module has its own dedicated flow coordinator, responsible for orchestrating the navigation within that feature.

Key Aspects:

Navigation Control: Ensures a clear separation of concerns for navigation logic within each feature.
Isolation: Prevents navigation complexity from spreading across the application.


##Conclusion
The multi-modular architecture, combined with the Flow Coordinator pattern, provides a scalable, maintainable, and reusable foundation for the project. This architectural approach aims to streamline development, enhance collaboration, and support the evolution of the application over time.
